# TODO:

# Questions

- Should the .env file that is handed in contain empty values for keys, or should the file just be empty or smth?

# Before handing in

- Should I take the steps so docker can be run without sudo?
- Remove evaluation_files/ and evaluation.html
- Double-check that no .env file is handed in
- Clone from intra and use it to go over the subject and eval sheet one more time
